# About
This repository provides a collection of KivyMD templates designed to simplify the process of creating basic, multi-screen prototype applications. Instead of spending valuable time piecing together fundamental functionalities—such as screen switching, basic settings integration, and simple UI components—these templates allow you to get started quickly and focus on your custom features.

Key Features:

- Multi-Screen Navigation: Easily add or remove custom screens without extensive code modifications.
- Ready-to-Use Components: Pre-built templates for fundamental UI elements
  - Light/Dark mode change.
  - Theme and Palette modification.
- Extensible Structure: Streamlined code organization makes it simple to incorporate new screens, settings, or visual elements as your app grows.

These templates are ideal for anyone looking to start a KivyMD project and quickly prototype their application's core functionalities, without getting bogged down in repetitive setup tasks.
